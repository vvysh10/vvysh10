    ALGORITHM:
    1.initize an empty dictionary called "cart" to store products and quantities.
    2.start the infinite loop that will continue until user enter to exit
    3.print the menu options for the user to enter the option
    4.prompt the user to enter for the option from the menu
    5.if the option=1: then prompt the user to enter for the product name(paname),if pname is in cart then print a message called "pname already exists"
    otherwise prompt the user the quantity of the product and store it in cart as product-qty pair
    and print a messge product added..
    6.if the user enters opt==2: prompt the user to enter for the product name, if the product present in the encourage the user to enter the quantity of the product
    and update the quantity of the product and print a message that product got updated.otherwise print a message that product doesnot exist in cart.
    7.if the user enter the opt==3:,prompt the user to enter for the product name if the product name is in the cart ,then delete the product using "del" keyword
    and update as the product got deleted otherwise print a message called product doesnot exist  in cart
    8.if the user option is opt==4,prompt the user to enter for the product name,if product name is in cart,then retrive the quantity of the product from cart dictionary
    and print a message of product quantity otherwise print a message product doesnot exist on cart dictionary
    9.if the user entered option is opt==5: then iterate over the items of cart dictionary and print product name corresponding to its quantity.
    10.if the user enters opt==6:break the loop and end the program
    11.after the loop ends ,the program will terminate.
