#create a dictionary with rollno as key and name as value
n=int(input("enter how many students"))
stud_dict={}
for i in range(n):
    rollno=int(input("Enter student roll no"))
    name=input("Enter student name")
    stud_dict[rollno]=name
print(stud_dict)



#with comprehension
stud_dict={int(input("enter rollno")):input("Enter name")for i in range(n)}
print(stud_dict)


#Algorithm:
1.The user is prompted to enter the number of students to stored in variable 'n'.
2.An empty dictionary is created to store the roll no as key and name as value.
3.A loop is initiated  to iterate 'n' times,where i takes the values from (0 to n-1).
4.for each iteration the user is prompted  to enter roll no which is stored in variable n.
5.The user is prompted to enter his name which is stored in varible name.
6.The roll no: and name are added to the dict "stud_dict" as key-value pair.
7.finally after all iterations of the loop are complete,the dict is printed.


#with compresion
same has programmed using comprehension.
