#create a dictionary with rollno as key and name as value
n=int(input("enter how many students"))
stud_dict={}
for i in range(n):
    rollno=int(input("Enter student roll no"))
    name=input("Enter student name")
    stud_dict[rollno]=name
print(stud_dict)



#with comprehension
stud_dict={int(input("enter rollno")):input("Enter name")for i in range(n)}
print(stud_dict)


#Algorithm:
1.The user is prompted to enter the number of students to stored in variable 'n'.
2.An empty dictionary is created to store the roll no as key and name as value.
3.A loop is initiated  to iterate 'n' times,where i takes the values from (0 to n-1).
4.for each iteration the user is prompted  to enter roll no which is stored in variable n.
5.The user is prompted to enter his name which is stored in varible name.
6.The roll no: and name are added to the dict "stud_dict" as key-value pair.
7.finally after all iterations of the loop are complete,the dict is printed.


#with compresion
same has programmed using comprehension.


#create a student dictionary with rollno as key and name ,2 subjects as values


n=int(input("enter how many studenrs"))
stud_dict={int(input("enter rollno:")):[input("enter name"),int(input("enter sub1:")),int(input("enter sub2"))]for i in range(n)}
for name,l in stud_dict.items():
    print(name,l)

#Algorithm:
1.The user is promoted to enter the number of students to store in variable n.
2.An Empty dictionary is created called "stud_dict" to store the student information,
3.initiate a loop for an range of "n",using loop variable i.
4.for each iteration of the loop ,perform the following steps:
  i)prompt the user to enter for student rollno to store in a variable roll no.
  ii)prompt the user to enter for the student name to store it in a variable called name.
  iii)prompt the user to enter marks of the first subject to store in a variable sub1.
  iv)prompt the user to enter marks of the second subject to store it in variable sub2.
 5.create a list to store the name,marks of the 2 subjects as value .
 6.Add list  to the dictionary as values to the key called rollno using syntax:stud_dict[rollno]=[name,sub1,sub2].
 7.initiate a loop to read the key value pair from stud_dict using name,l as variable
 8.Within Each iteration of the loop print name corresponding list of values(name,sub1,sub2)
