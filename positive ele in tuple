#Python program to find Tuples with positive elements in List of tuples

tuples = [(-1, 2), (3, 4), (-5, -6), (7, 8)] 
result=[]
for tuple in tuples:
   if (ele > 0 for ele in tuple):
       result.append(tuple)
   print(result)



Algorithm:
1. Initialize list of tuples 
2. We define empty list called result
3.iterate through the tuples using indexed value called tuple
4.if ele in tuple of ele > 0 then in which ele is in  tuple
5.append the tuple in result using append fub=nction
6.finally we print the contents of result
