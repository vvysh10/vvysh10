#Count occurrences of an element in a list
n=int(input("Enter how many elements "))
l1=[]
c=0
for i in range(n):
    i=int(input("enter number"))
    l1.append(i)
print(l1)
n1=int(input("enter any number"))
for i in l1:
    if n1==i
        c=c+1
print("The occurance of a  number",n1,":",c)


#Algorithm::
1.The user is promoted to enter the number of elements they want include in the list.
2.An empty list is created to store the numbers.
3.The variable c is initialized to "0" ,it is used to count the occurance of specified number.And then a loop is started to iterate upto "n" times,where n is promoted by user
4.the user again promoted to enter the number to store on the list.
5.The number then converted into iteger and store in the list l1.
6.then the list is printed using output function.
the user is encouage to enter the number for occurance "n1"
7.Another loop is started ,iterating over each element inside the list "i"
8.inside the loop,an if condition to check if a number "i" in list is equals to the user entered number i.e. "n1"
9.if the condition is true ,then increment the variable c by "1".
10.finally print the occurance of a user specified number by printing the counter variable c.



#Find sum and average of List in Python
l1=[1,2,3,4,5]
s=0
for i in l1:
    s=s+i
    i=i+1
print(s)
l1=len(l1)
print(l1)
avg=s/l1
print(avg)


#Algorithm::
1.the lsit l1 is used to store the number that want to find sum and avaerage .
2.The variable s is initialized to "0",which is used to store the value of sum of list.
3.a loop is started to iterate over the elements "i" in the list l1.
4.inside the loop,each element is added to the sum which is in shortend "s+=i".
5.the loop has ends,the length of the list is stored in l1.
6.The avaerage is calculated by dividing sum with the lenth of the list(l1)
7.finally sum and average is printed using print function.



#Sum of number digits in List
n=int(input("Enter how many numbers"))
l1=[]
l2=[]
for i in range(n):
    i=int(input("enter any number"))
    l1.append(i)
    for ele in l1:
        s1=0
        for digit in str(ele):
            s1+=int(digit)
    l2.append(s1)
print(l1)
print(str(l2))


#Algorithm::
1.the user is promoted to enter how many numbers to include in the list.
2. Two empty lists l1[],l2[] are created to enter the number enter by the user in l1,where another list is to store sum of the digits in the list
3.a loop is started to iterate "n" where "n" value is specified by the user.
4.Inside the loop,user is promoted to enter the number that need to be stored in the list l1.
5.then later the number is converted into integer and added to the list
6. inside the loop,another loop has started to iterate over the list l1.
7.inside the nested loop the variable s1 is initialixed to "0",which is used to sum the digits of the current element.
8.Another loop is started ,iterating over each digit in the element string representation
     The str() function converts each number into a string,and the outer loop iterates each character in the string
9.Inside the loop,each digit character converted back into integer using int(digit) ,and added to the sum " s1+=int(digit).
10.After the inner loop ends,and the sum is added to the list l2
11.then the outer loop gets ended,the lists l1,l2 are printed to display the numbers entered by user and crossponding to the sum of the digits of each number.
